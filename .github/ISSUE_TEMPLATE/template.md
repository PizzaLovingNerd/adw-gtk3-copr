- [ ] I installed the theme from the tarball.
- [ ] I installed the theme from git.

- [ ] The theme is the latest available version/git commit.
- [ ] I've installed the light flatpak theme: `org.gtk.Gtk3theme.adw-gtk3`
- [ ] I've installed the dark flatpak theme: `org.gtk.Gtk3theme.adw-gtk3-dark`
- [ ] The file `~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css` does not exist or is empty.
